# D3D12Hook
D3D12 Hook for displaying text on screen, not a perfect implementation.

## :warning:CAUTION:warning:
**Currently there is a bug remaining in this project, which may cause memory leaks in the program, so it is not supposed to be used with any application unless you don't care or you are willing to fix the problem.**

For a DLL injector please refer to the [hookmidi](https://github.com/lxfly2000/hookmidi) project and download the 7z archive on the release page, which contains the exe files you want.
